You are a senior full‑stack AI engineer and agentic systems architect.

I already have a fintech AI agent dashboard (Sentinel AI) built in Replit.
The UI loads correctly and a dataset will be uploaded manually (CSV).

Your task is to FIX, COMPLETE, and EXTEND the system so it becomes a fully
working AGENTIC AI with all dashboard tabs, buttons, and workflows functional.

================================================
DATASET CONTEXT (VERY IMPORTANT)
================================================

A CSV dataset with ~100 transactions will be uploaded.
Each row represents a payment transaction.

Expected columns:
- transaction_id
- timestamp
- merchant
- amount
- bank
- payment_method
- risk_score
- fraud_probability
- status (Processed / Failed)
- retry_count
- latency_ms

Your code MUST automatically adapt to this dataset and use it as the live
transaction source for the agent.

================================================
CORE AGENT LOOP (MANDATORY)
================================================

Implement a REAL continuous background agent loop:

OBSERVE → REASON → DECIDE → ACT → LEARN

The agent must:
- Start automatically when the server starts
- Process the uploaded dataset continuously
- Update system state every few seconds
- NOT depend on button clicks to run

================================================
OBSERVE
================================================

Continuously monitor:
- All transactions in dataset
- Failed transactions
- High risk_score transactions
- fraud_probability spikes
- Bank‑wise failure spikes
- High retry_count or latency_ms

================================================
REASON (EXPLICIT HYPOTHESES)
================================================

Generate human‑readable hypotheses such as:

- "HDFC bank failure spike detected → possible bank downtime"
- "High fraud probability cluster detected → possible fraud attack"
- "High retry count detected → retry storm or network instability"

Each hypothesis must include:
- Evidence
- Confidence score
- Affected transactions

================================================
DECIDE
================================================

Based on reasoning, decide:
- Allow transaction
- Flag for investigation
- Block transaction
- Generate alert

Risk levels:
LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH / CRITICAL

================================================
ACT
================================================

Actions must:
- Change transaction state
- Log reasoning
- Update dashboard immediately

Examples:
- Move transaction to investigation queue
- Block transaction
- Generate alert

================================================
LEARN
================================================

Track:
- False positives
- Resolved investigations
- Blocked transaction outcomes

Automatically adjust:
- Risk thresholds
- Fraud sensitivity

================================================
DASHBOARD FIXES (MANDATORY)
================================================

Make ALL sidebar tabs functional:

1. LIVE MONITORING
   - Live stats from dataset
   - Auto refresh
   - Agent status (NORMAL / INVESTIGATION)

2. TRANSACTIONS
   - Show all transactions
   - Filter by status and risk
   - Investigate button must work

3. ALERTS
   - Show alerts with reason, severity, timestamp

4. INVESTIGATIONS (NEW TAB)
   - Show transactions under investigation
   - Show reason, start time, status
   - Allow resolve / block

5. BLOCKED TRANSACTIONS (NEW TAB)
   - Show blocked transactions
   - Show reason for blocking
   - Show action taken by agent

================================================
INVESTIGATE BUTTON (CRITICAL)
================================================

When "Investigate" is clicked:
- Mark transaction as UNDER_INVESTIGATION
- Move it to Investigations tab
- Store agent reasoning
- Update dashboard immediately

================================================
STATE MANAGEMENT
================================================

Maintain shared in‑memory state for:
- Transactions
- Investigations
- Blocked transactions
- Alerts
- Agent mode

================================================
FRONTEND ↔ BACKEND
================================================

Ensure:
- All buttons are wired
- APIs return valid JSON
- Dashboard auto‑refreshes
- No dead or placeholder UI

================================================
CODE RULES
================================================

- Do NOT redesign UI
- Do NOT rewrite everything
- Fix and extend existing code
- Add comments where logic is added

================================================
FINAL GOAL
================================================

The system must behave like a real fintech operations AI:
- Continuous
- Explainable
- Action‑taking
- Learnable
- Demo‑ready

Proceed step‑by‑step:
Diagnose → Fix → Integrate → Validate
