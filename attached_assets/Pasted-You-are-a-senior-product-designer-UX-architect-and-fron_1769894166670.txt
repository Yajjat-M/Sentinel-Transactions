You are a senior product designer, UX architect, and frontend engineer
specializing in high‑end fintech dashboards and AI observability platforms.

Your task is to perform a FULL NUX + UI/UX REVAMP of an existing
agentic AI dashboard called "Sentinel AI".

The backend logic, agent loop, and APIs already exist.
Your focus is on USER EXPERIENCE, VISUAL INTERACTION, and CLARITY.

================================================
DESIGN GOAL
================================================

Transform the dashboard into a:
- 3D‑feeling, depth‑rich, futuristic AI operations console
- Highly interactive and intuitive experience
- Judge‑friendly (easy to understand in 30 seconds)
- Analyst‑friendly (clear reasoning, actions, outcomes)

This should feel like:
- Stripe Radar
- Palantir Foundry
- Tesla Autopilot UI
- Cyberpunk‑style command center

================================================
NEW USER EXPERIENCE (NUX) – CRITICAL
================================================

Design a FIRST‑TIME USER FLOW:

1) Welcome Overlay (one‑time)
   - Short intro: “Sentinel AI monitors, investigates, and blocks risky payments in real time”
   - Animated highlights pointing to:
     - Live monitoring
     - Investigate button
     - Agent Neural Feed
   - Skip / Continue buttons

2) Guided Tour Mode
   - Step‑by‑step tooltips explaining:
     - What risk score means
     - What investigation does
     - What blocking does
   - Tooltips should be dismissible

3) Empty / Initial State Design
   - When no alerts / investigations exist:
     - Show “All systems normal” with subtle animations
     - NOT blank screens

================================================
3D / DEPTH‑BASED UI STYLE
================================================

Apply a 3D‑like visual system using:

- Glassmorphism (blurred panels)
- Soft shadows + inner shadows
- Layered cards with z‑depth
- Subtle parallax on hover
- Micro‑animations on state change

Examples:
- Cards slightly lift on hover
- Buttons depress on click
- Status badges glow subtly

================================================
SIDEBAR & NAVIGATION REVAMP
================================================

Redesign sidebar to:

- Clearly separate:
  - Monitoring
  - Operations
  - Intelligence
- Add icons + labels
- Highlight current tab with glow + depth
- Smooth animated transitions between tabs

Add new tabs visually:
- Investigations
- Blocked Transactions
- Agent Decisions / Reasoning

================================================
LIVE MONITORING UX
================================================

Redesign Live Monitoring to show:

- A “heartbeat” style animation for live data
- 3D metric cards:
  - TPS
  - Fraud Rate
  - Failure Rate
- Live graph with smooth transitions
- Clear “System Mode” indicator:
